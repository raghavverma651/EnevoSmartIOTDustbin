# EnevoSmartIOTDustbin
This is the Arduino Code for the microcontroller NodeMCU which updates the values of the distance observed from the top of the lid and simultaneously the location of said dustbin to a realtime database called FireBase.

The Code as it is should work but some changes need to be made to the -
1) Wifi SSID
2) Wifi Password
3) Firebase Host
4) Firebase Authentication Key
5) Google Geolocation API
